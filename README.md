# Attendance Management System using Face Recognition

## Overview

This project is an automated attendance management system that uses face recognition technology to mark attendance. The system captures images of students, trains a model to recognize their faces, and records their attendance when they appear in front of the camera. This approach simplifies and speeds up the attendance process while minimizing errors and the need for manual intervention.

## Features

- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Uses Haarcascade classifiers to detect and recognize faces.
- **Automatic Attendance Marking**: Records attendance automatically when a student's face is recognized.
- **Manual Attendance Marking**: Provides an option to mark attendance manually if needed.
- **Attendance Viewing**: Allows viewing of attendance records.
- **Image Capture**: Captures and stores images of students for training the recognition model.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model using captured images.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Pandas

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup and Usage

1. **Capture Student Images**: Run `takeImage.py` to capture images of the students. These images will be used to train the face recognition model.
2. **Train the Model**: Run `trainImage.py` to train the model with the captured images.
3. **Mark Attendance Automatically**: Run `automaticAttedance.py` to start the attendance marking process. The system will detect and recognize faces and mark attendance accordingly.
4. **View Attendance**: Run `show_attendance.py` to view the attendance records.
5. **Manual Attendance**: Run `takemanually.py` if you need to mark attendance manually.
